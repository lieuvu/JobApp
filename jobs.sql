INSERT INTO "jobs" VALUES(4,5,'Ruby on Rails Developer','Design, implement and support a custom coded hosting platform for Web Based Training (WBT) products. The platform shall have hosting, access control, metrics and web service integration with the enterprise training system. The Developer will have access to the legacy Coldfusion application, but this project will result in a new Application with new, but similar, functionality. Though data (course completion records, WBT usage metrics) migration will be expected, this should not be approached as a platform migration - the new application should improve on quality, performance and capabilities. The Developer position is expected to lead all development work, but will be part of a new internal Team that includes surge development support (not to exceed 20% of all development work to be completed), project requirement and management support, and work in conjunction with existing WBT developers to ensure application capability with existing and future WBT products. This position will require infrequent interaction with external stakeholders. Though some existing legacy code exist, this is expected to be a completely new solution with no existing code. This is expected to be a modern web application. A good reference for expected product delivery example would be a medium Moodle-like deployment which supported the delivery of HTML5, ActionScript 2 & 3, and SCORM compliant WBT products with an administrative back-end for management of courses and metric reporting.

Successful candidates should be experienced in the following:
